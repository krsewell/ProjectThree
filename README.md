What to Submit:

Save all project files in a directory named with the following format: <netID>_Project<number>. This
directory should contain all header files, source code files and any IDE based project file. Zip up
the directory into a standard Zip file. Please do not create a RAR or 7-Zip file, just a .zip file.


Objective: 

Implement a non-trivial algorithm in C++.


Problem: 

A Magic Square of order N consists of N^2 squares, each of which contains a number from 1 through N^2
such that the rows, columns, and diagonals sum to the same thing (called the magic sum). For example,
the following is a magic square of order 3 with a magic sum of 15:

6 1 8
7 5 3
2 9 4


Input: 

Your program should ask the user to enter an odd integer. For the purposes of this program, treat
the input as an unsigned short. Every odd number up to 999 is valid for this program. The program 
should continue prompting for numbers and printing magic squares until the user enters a zero. If an 
even number is entered, print an appropriate error message and prompt the user to enter another number.


Output: 

The program should output the magic squares to a text file. You donâ€™t need to print the boxes around
the numbers, but arrange the numbers in columns and rows so the square is readable using print 
formatting. In addition to the magic square, also print out the magic sum.


Miscellaneous: This program must use functions and arrays. It is your decision how many functions are 
used and how they are defined. There is an algorithm for creating magic squares; make sure you do your
research before tackling this program.
